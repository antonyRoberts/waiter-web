The only thing I've done here is:
  1) Added node-sass to package.json and installed via npm
  
  2) Rename app.component.css to app.component.scss so that is is sass instead of standard css
  
    --Do not change the stylUrls ['app.component.css'] as the compiler will automatically compile the saas to css
    
  3) Added class="demo" to the div I added in your app.component.html file so the div is styled as we are defining in app.component.scss .demo
